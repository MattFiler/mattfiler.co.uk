            <p>The "Homebase POS Generator" was a site I made while working at Homebase to overcome the internal process of creating signage for product displays in-store. The process required us to download template signage from the company intranet, adjust the price, title and description manually through PowerPoint (which was not installed on all computers) and then print. As you can imagine, doing this for many items in a day took up a considerable amount of time - so I saw an opportunity for a solution!</p>
            <img src="IMG/project_homebasepos/step3.jpg">
            <p>In my free time I created a site that required only three to four simple inputs - item code, item name, item description and a previous item price if it was reduced. Sample titles and descriptions were provided to the user through existing data that was pulled from the internal company item database and public website to speed up the process further. Additionally, when the signage was printed, the edited titles and descriptions were stored in a database that was pulled from in future printing of that same item - so without realising it employees were saving time for other people who may print that signage in future! Price was always pulled from the internal database so couldn't be incorrect at the time of printing, as this same system was used for all till points.</p>
            <p>Not only was it a smart back-end, the site had a friendly front-end UI and a fluid UX. As a result, it quickly became adoped as the standard process in my store and saved countless hours during the working day. An added unseen bonus was that it unified all signs throughout the store, whereas previously a lot of signs had varying pricing placements due to the less restrictive nature of the PowerPoint templates. This made it easier for shoppers to identify item prices and gave a tidier appearance throughout.</p>
            <p>Alongside the desktop version of the site, I also created a mobile interface which allowed staff to scan barcodes on shop floor to add to a "queue" that was accessible on the desktop version to print. This was very useful for printing large amounts of signage and also saved considerable time writing down item codes!</p>
            <img src="IMG/project_homebasepos/step1.jpg">
            <p>The staff at my store found the tool helpful so it was eventually demonstrated to the regional manager on a visit who promptly implemented it in a number of other stores in the region.</p>
            <p>As this project uses a private company API and is still in use internally I can't provide a link to the site, however a library of screenshots can be seen at the links below to give you an idea of the user interface and output it produced.</p>

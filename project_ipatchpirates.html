            <p>i-Patch Pirates was my first shipped title at PlayWest, a games studio operated by UWE Bristol. The game was funded by UWE IT Services and aimed to promote cyber security to students and staff across both UWE campuses. I joined the project around two months from the ship date and helped push it through multiple major milestones and presentations.</p>

            <p>The 2019 game is a continuation of the 2018 project under the same name, however we added two new gamemodes, reworked major core gameplay mechanics, and introduced a number of new systems. We also targetted the game for a new platform, Android, which required reworking some older code.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities for the project were to implement several key new systems such as achievements, tutorials, and an arcade login. I also worked across the project fixing miscellaneous bugs as they arose, tidying older systems for modular use, and updating the UI to use animators. As well as this I created the promotional trailer and splash for our WebGL build.</p>

            <p>I was also in charge of creating a locker hacking minigame which had players guess part of a player's login code in order to break into that player's locker and steal their gold or buried treasure location. If a buried treasure location was found, it would be marked on the world map and players could explore to find it. Upon finding the treasure location the player had a chance to dig it up by playing a gem matching minigame. The aim of the locker hacking was to encourage players to pick stronger passwords and change them regularly.</p>

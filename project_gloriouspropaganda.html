            <p>As my second and final year one coding assignment at university I had to create Angry Birds. I wanted my game to be similar in style to the original Angry Birds however all happen within the one window. I started by decompiling the original Angry Birds Flash game to get assets for the pigs and birds.</p>
            <p>Eventually I discovered some higher quality assets for these online, however I kept the original blocks from the Flash game (hence the lower quality) as they had all damage states which allowed me to create a block health system.</p>
            <img src="IMG/project_asge/angrybirds_gamespace.jpg">
            <p>All character and block entities in-game had a health mechanic. Blocks had varying heath, for example, the glass/ice block would only require two hits to destroy, while the rock block would require four. Blocks also had a number of different styles, which were uniform across all types. These were long rectangle, square, and tall rectangle.</p>
            <p>Having three different styles and three different types of block allowed for a good variety of assets in the levels - each with a maximum of four supported destruction states. All of these assets were loaded to objects which could be easily placed within the level via a basic visual level editor tool I built.</p>
            <p>Each character also had a number of different visuals, some representative of health, while others representative of state. For example, when you launch a bird from the catapult, it will go cross-eyed! All characters blinked at random intervals during the game to give them extra life. Pig health could easily be told by its current visual, just like in the original Angry Birds game.</p>
            <img src="IMG/project_asge/angrybirds_launch.jpg">
            <p>I also added the iconic dot trail behind each bird to show its trajectory, along with the equally iconic glove cursor for interacting with the bird in the catapult. Cartoon explosion FX was implemented upon a bird hitting a block or an entity being destroyed, along with FX of score bonuses popping up as required.</p>
            <p>A scoreboard was implemented which displayed on the main menu where levels were selected. This is similar to the original Angry Birds game and I quite like how intuitive it is.</p>
            <p>The game's audio was run via irrKlang, a super useful library which allowed me to layer up a number of sounds to give different sound effects to each block type and state, along with each character.</p>
            <img src="IMG/project_asge/angrybirds_levelselect.jpg">
            <p>I was much more happy with the code layout in this project, it built on the class abstraction I used in PONG however didn't make it too hard to find anything you were after. My custom objects for characters, FX and other elements was also quite a neat system which could easily be expanded if I revisited  the project in future.</p>
            <p>The final project can be found in multiple forms below.</p>

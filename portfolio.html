                <h3>ALIEN ISOLATION ZOMBIES</h3>
                <p>A custom map for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 created as a personal project to learn more about the game development process before starting my university course. It taught me everything from texture types to scripting for different player's approaches, as well as some unexpected things like community interaction and publicity.</p>

                <p>As part of my university course I developed a number of projects in OpenGL through UWE's own barebones OpenGL engine, codenamed ASGE. These projects are all available as compliable source code through GitHub, or pre-compiled through itch.io.</p>

                <p>The ARTSTATION demo was a WebGL interactive pointcloud "tech demo" created during a 10 week internship for a Heritage Lottery funded project. I acted as lead programmer and network engineer. It was my first client-driven project and taught me a lot about working to a brief and managing client expectations.</p>

                <p>I've developed a number of mods for Alien: Isolation, but perhaps my biggest achievement is the creation of the "Alien: Isolation Mod Tools" - a modding toolkit for the game allowing you to edit a vast range of game configurations including behaviour trees via a visual flowchart interface, realtime radiosity, and much more!</p>

                <p>While working at Homebase as a Sales Assistant, I identified an opportunity to streamline the company's process of generating in-store signage for product displays. To remove the need for PowerPoint templates and the risk of human error with labelling prices, I developed a web platform to automate the process.</p>

                <p>This was a feature-length film that I shot and edited over three months at secondary school, it was a great learning curve for me to find out just how challenging creating a full 45 minute film is - even a super low budget indie one! We premiered the film of an evening at our school and donated all proceeds charity.</p>

The project was very data driven with multiple account levels including the leadership team, regular teaching staff, students and parents.</p>

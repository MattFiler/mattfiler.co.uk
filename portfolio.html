                <h3>PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE</h3>
                <p>In a group of four I developed "Planned Obsolescence", a top-down 2D strategy game where you play as an AI in control of a research lab with the goal of secretly destroying the research projects. I developed a toolset for generating configuration files which I then scripted support for in the game itself, allowing easy modification of character attributes, map layouts, and more.</p>

                <p>I created a tool for developing text adventures through a modern designer-focused flowchart UI. This tool allowed for localisation across a number of languages, as well as the ability to very easily export your creation to a number of game engine implementations - including UE4, OpenGL and Unity.</p>

                <p>While learning about level design, I created a fictional game titled "Accursed: Khulman's Tale" and developed documentation and a functioning demo for one of its levels. This was my first attempt at Unreal Engine 4 and allowed me to not only learn Blueprint through scripted sequences, but put into practice a number of level design concepts.</p>
